# Aunsorm API Gateway Routing Configuration
#
# This file defines how incoming requests are routed to microservices
# Gateway runs on port 50010 and routes to services on ports 50011-50018

# Routing Rules:
# /oauth/*        -> auth-service:50011    (JWT, OAuth operations)
# /security/*     -> auth-service:50011    (Token generation, verification)
# /sfu/*         -> sfu-service:50021      (Secure media sessions) 
# /core/*        -> crypto-service:50012   (Core cryptography)
# /cert/*        -> x509-service:50013     (Certificate operations)
# /x509/*        -> x509-service:50013     (X.509 management)
# /kms/*         -> kms-service:50014      (Key management)
# /keys/*        -> kms-service:50014      (Key operations)
# /mdm/*         -> mdm-service:50015      (Mobile device management)
# /device/*      -> mdm-service:50015      (Device operations)
# /id/*          -> id-service:50016       (Identity management)
# /identity/*    -> id-service:50016       (Identity operations)
# /acme/*        -> acme-service:50017     (Let's Encrypt)
# /pqc/*         -> pqc-service:50018      (Post-quantum crypto)
# /quantum/*     -> pqc-service:50018      (Quantum-safe operations)
# /random/*      -> rng-service:50019      (Cryptographic RNG)
# /blockchain/*  -> blockchain-service:50020 (DID verification, Fabric)
# /metrics       -> metrics-service:50022  (Prometheus metrics)

# Health checks for all services are available at:
# /health        -> gateway health (aggregated)
# /health/auth   -> auth-service:50011/health
# /health/crypto -> crypto-service:50012/health
# /health/x509   -> x509-service:50013/health
# /health/kms    -> kms-service:50014/health
# /health/mdm    -> mdm-service:50015/health
# /health/id     -> id-service:50016/health
# /health/acme   -> acme-service:50017/health
# /health/pqc    -> pqc-service:50018/health
# /health/rng    -> rng-service:50019/health
# /health/blockchain -> blockchain-service:50020/health
# /health/sfu    -> sfu-service:50021/health
# /health/metrics -> metrics-service:50022/health

# Metrics aggregation:
# /metrics       -> gateway metrics (aggregated from all services)
